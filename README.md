# TimeSeriesAnalysis
This repo contains my learning documentation on time series analysis.

[TimeSeries.ipynb](https://nbviewer.org/github/tmtsmrsl/TimeSeriesAnalysis/blob/main/TimeSeries.ipynb) is adapted from the materials taught in [Practical Time Series Analysis course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-time-series-analysis/) offered by The State University of New York. The course is based on R programming language, but the notebook is implemented using Python.  

Notes: Please view the notebook through [nbviewer.org](https://nbviewer.org/) to see the Plotly figure.
